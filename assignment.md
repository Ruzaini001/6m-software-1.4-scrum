## Assignment

### Brief

Write your answers for each question:

Question 1:
Imagine you are hired by a startup company for a school to implement their IT infrastructure as their IT consultant. n your own words (300 words or less), describe how could implementing Scrum help their IT team improve their productivity.

```
Implementing Scrum can help to increase productivity by creating a more organized, collaborative, and flexible working environment.

With transparency, everyone involved is aware of the team’s progress. For a school startup, it is important that the people in charge, educators, and IT team all have a shared understanding of what’s being built, for example the school portal or scheduling system. Inspection is carried out through frequent reviews and meetings, to catch problems early. Adaptation is about being flexible, adjusting to feedback from teachers or students.

Scrum have 5 core values. Courage encourages people to admit any troubles faced and seek help. This is useful in startups, where not everything is clear-cut. Focus keeps the team aligned on whats important. Commitment ensures everyone is dedicated to build a functional systems that help the school. Respect and openness helps to create a culture where everyone can collaborate and trust each other. Important in a fast-moving environments.

There is also clear roles in a scrum team, which includes, product owner, scrum master, and development team. Each person knows their responsibilities, reducing confusion and unnecessary overlap in tasks.

Scrum helps to break down large, complex projects into smaller, manageable parts called sprints. Usually 1 to 4 weeks. This helps to deliver specific goals quickly and consistently. Scrum also promotes daily meetings where team share progress, challenges, and plans for the day, ensuring everyone on the same page.

In a school startup, sudden change in requirements can occur. Scrum allows the team to adapt easily between sprints. For example, if teachers request their intent to conduct online quiz on certain date, those requests can be prioritized in the next sprint.

Scrum also encourages continuous improvement through regular retrospectives, where the team reflects on what worked well and what could be improved.
