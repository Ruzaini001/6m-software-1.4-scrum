Question 2:
Write ten (10) user stories for a book-borrowing website for a library. Write it in the format: `As a ____, I want to ____, so that _____`.

```
1) As a user who wants to borrow specific books, I want to be able to search for an exact title, author or genre in the website, so that I am able to get the book I am looking for.
2) As a eBooks user, I want to have the option to borrow eBooks as well, so that it will be more hassle-free.
3) As registered user, I want to be able to make reservation, so that I am in the queue of receiving the book once someone else has returned.
4) As a user who borrows multiple books, I want to be able to check all my loaned books, so that I can keep track on all of them.
5) As a user who lives far away from the library, I want to have the choice of books delivered at my doorstep, so that it will be more convenience.
6) As a reader who reads at slower pace, I want to be able to renew my loan, so that I can extend the time in reading the book.
7) As a avid reader, I want to have books recommended to me based on my interest and past books loaned, so that I know what to read next.
8) As a registered user, I want to be able to give review and ratings to books I loaned, so that I can share my opinion and help others.
9) As a user who happen to lost or damaged the loaned books, I want to be able to make payment for the fines or charges in the website, so that it can be settled quickly.
10) As a registered user, I want to receive email/SMS notification for loaned books that are due soon, so that I can avoid return books on time.
